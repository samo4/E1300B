110  REM ##
112  REM ## Given are comments showing examples of settings which you may wish
114  REM ## to change.  If you have a fairly standard configuration you may
116  REM ## not need to change any of these settings.

122  REM ## Configuration file format:
124  REM ##
126  REM ##    The beginning of the useful information on each line is the 
128  REM ## part following "linenumber REM " ("linenumber REM " is ignored).
130  REM ## All lines beginning with "#" are comments.  Lines which are  
132  REM ## intended to always be comments start with "##".  Lines which you
134  REM ## may wish to modify and use, start with a single "#".  All setting
136  REM ## labels are not case sensitive and should be separated from the
138  REM ## associated values by an equal sign "=".  Any unrecognized setting
140  REM ## labels are ignored, so avoid misspellings.  If you have more than
142  REM ## one line defining a setting, but that setting can take on only one
144  REM ## value, then the first value found will be used.
146  REM ##
148  REM ##    The default revision of this file format is "A.03.00".  
150  REM ## This should not be changed.

160  REM ## File access:
162  REM ##
164  REM ##    If you are downloading via IBASIC or DOS you must have your 
166  REM ## current directory writable.
168  REM ##
170  REM ##    The default directory to look in when looking for drivers and 
172  REM ## to write to when logging information about the program's progress 
174  REM ## is the directory you were in when you started the program.
176  REM ##
178  REM #DIRECTORY=
180  REM ##
182  REM ##    If you wish to access files in some other directory specify 
184  REM ## either an absolute or relative directory path.  You must include 
186  REM ## the trailing character which separates the directory name from the
188  REM ## file name(s) which will be appended to it.  This user command
190  REM ## is supported by both DOS and HP HFS type directories.  HP LIF
192  REM ## directories must use the default directory.
194  REM ##
196  REM #DIRECTORY=C:\VXIDLD\
198  REM #DIRECTORY=../DRIVERS/
200  REM ##
202  REM ##    If you assign a value to EXECUTION LOG you must have the 
204  REM ## DIRECTORY you will be using writable.  The default place to
206  REM ## log information about the program's progress is to send it 
208  REM ## only to the screen.  If you wish for it to also go to a file
210  REM ## then you must specify the file name as shown below.
212  REM ## Note that some of the initial information (before the EXECUTION
214  REM ## LOG is read from this file) will not appear in the log.
216  REM ## Also IBASIC will only log the information after the last reboot.
218  REM ##
220  REM #EXECUTION LOG=VXIDLD.LOG
222  REM ##
224  REM ##    The default system program files to use are the ones with  
226  REM ## the proper suffix in the DIRECTORY specified.  The defaults  
228  REM ## when using the HP-IB interface are the ones ending in "PU".    
230  REM ## When using the RS-232 interface the files will have the ending 
232  REM ## "PC".  If more than one system program file set is in the     
234  REM ## directory, then the last set found will be used.  If a file    
236  REM ## set is specified here, then it will take priority over the other 
238  REM ## file sets found.  Only the 1st file name of the file set should 
240  REM ## be specified here.  System program downloading can only be
242  REM ## accomplished when downloading to command modules containing
244  REM ## FLASH ROM capability such as the HP E1406A.  Downloading
246  REM ## the system program requires that you erase your memory
248  REM ## allocations first.  This includes Driver RAM (DRAM),
250  REM ## Non-volatile RAM (NRAM), RAM DISK (RDISK) and FLASH ROM (FROM).
252  REM ##
254  REM ## We use file names of the form "abbcc1.dd" or "Iabbcc1.dd".
256  REM ##
258  REM ## File names with the prefix "I" indicate that IBASIC is included.
260  REM ## a  is the 1st part of the code revision (e.g. the A of A.09.00)
262  REM ## bb is the 2nd part of the code revision (e.g. the 09 of A.09.00)
264  REM ## cc is the 3rd part of the code revision (e.g. the 00 of A.09.00)
266  REM ##  1 indicates this is the 1st part of the system program to be
268  REM ##    loaded.  VXIDLD then searches for the remaining files of the 
270  REM ##    file set.
272  REM ## dd is the suffix PU or PC as described above. 
274  REM ##
276  REM #PROGRAM FILE=IA09001.PC
278  REM #PROGRAM FILE=IA09001_PU
280  REM ##
282  REM ##    The default driver files to use are all files with the proper 
284  REM ## suffix in the DIRECTORY specified.  The default when using the 
286  REM ## HP-IB interface is all the files ending in "DU".  The default when 
288  REM ## using the RS-232 interface is all the files ending in "DC".
290  REM ## If you wish to specify which driver files should be used you may
292  REM ## list them here. If you wish to download several files, you may 
294  REM ## have several lines like the following with each defining one
296  REM ## driver to be downloaded.  A "." indicates a DOS or HP HFS file
298  REM ## name where "_" is required for an HP LIF file name.  If no drivers
300  REM ## are specified here then VXIDLD will download all (maximum of 20) 
302  REM ## of the valid drivers that it finds having the correct suffix.
304  REM ## If you have an HP E1406A command module then you have the option  
306  REM ## to download your drivers to FLASH ROM (FROM) as well as Driver RAM
308  REM ## (DRAM).  Downloading drivers to FROM will not affect your memory
310  REM ## allocations in RAM DISK (RDISK), Non-volatile RAM (NRAM) or
312  REM ## DRAM.  However, VXIDLD will not download drivers to FROM if
314  REM ## drivers already exist there.  This area must be erased first.
316  REM ## This is also true when downloading drivers to DRAM.  When
318  REM ## downloading drivers to DRAM, your NRAM and RDISK areas must
320  REM ## be erased first.

332  REM ## I/O interface address selection:
334  REM ##
336  REM ##    You may specify which I/O interface address on your computer   
338  REM ## you wish to use to communicate with the VXI mainframe.
340  REM ##
342  REM ##    The communications interface you will be using when running  
344  REM ## from any of Hewlett-Packard's BASIC environments is the "HP-IB" 
346  REM ## interface (also known as IEEE 488.1).  Selection of a specific 
348  REM ## HP-IB interface consists of an address in the form "sspp00".
350  REM ##   ss is the select code used for the interface
352  REM ##   pp is the primary address used for the VXI mainframe
354  REM ##   00 is the secondary address used for the SYSTEM instrument
356  REM ##
358  REM ## The default interface address when not running in IBASIC is 70900.
360  REM #ADDRESS=70900
362  REM ## The default interface address when running in IBASIC is 80900.
364  REM #ADDRESS=80900
366  REM ##
368  REM ##    The communications interface you will be using when running  
370  REM ## from DOS is the "RS-232" interface.  When using the RS-232
372  REM ## interface, the serial cable must be connected to either the 
374  REM ## built-in RS-232 connection on the VXI command module , or an   
376  REM ## RS-232 module (E1324A) which is set to interrupt at the default
378  REM ## interrupt level (level 1).
380  REM ##
382  REM ##    Selection of RS-232 interface consists of an address which is
384  REM ## "1" for COM1 or "2" for COM2.  The default interface address
386  REM ## when running in DOS is "1" (COM1)
388  REM ##
390  REM #ADDRESS=1
392  REM ##
394  REM ##    When using RS-232 you may specify the baud rate.  The default 
396  REM ## is 9600 (which is also the default for the VXI mainframe after a
398  REM ## DIAG:BOOT:COLD).  The allowed values are 300, 1200, 2400, 4800,
400  REM ## 7200, or 9600 (19200 is not supported by DOS).  A modification
402  REM ## here would require that your VXI Mainframe be changed first and
404  REM ## then stored using "DIAG:COMM:SER:STOR" prior to VXIDLD execution.
406  REM ##
408  REM #BAUD=9600
410  REM ##
412  REM ##    When using RS-232 you may specify the number of stop bits per 
414  REM ## byte.  The default is 1 (which is also the default for the VXI
416  REM ## mainframe after a DIAG:BOOT:COLD).  The allowed values are 1 or 2.
418  REM ##
420  REM #STOP BITS=1
422  REM 
424  REM #####################################################################
426  REM ## Memory usage:
428  REM ##
430  REM ##    If you wish to use part of your memory for NRAM or RDISK,
432  REM ## then you may wish to set those up at the same time VXIDLD is 
434  REM ## setting up your DRAM space (defined by the number and size
436  REM ## of the drivers being downloaded to DRAM).  Downloading drivers
438  REM ## to FROM will ignore all NRAM and RDISK requests.  Un-specified
440  REM ## NRAM and RDISK have a default size of 0.
442  REM ##
444  REM #NRAM=0
446  REM #RDISK=0
448  REM ##
450  REM ## Once drivers are loaded, changes in NRAM and RDISK size will
452  REM ## not affect the drivers loaded in DRAM.  However caution must be
454  REM ## observed when modifying NRAM since this will affect your RDISK
456  REM ## area.  Changes in RDISK can be made at any time.
458  REM 
460  REM #####################################################################
462  REM ## Configuration commands:
464  REM ##
466  REM ##    You may also wish to send other commands to setup your VXI 
468  REM ## mainframe at various points in the download procedure.  If you   
470  REM ## wish you may add those commands here and they will be sent by the 
472  REM ## VXIDLD program.
474  REM ##    These commands should have the form "label=address,command" 
476  REM ## where address is the secondary address of the instrument which 
478  REM ## should receive the command (it will be converted to LADD if used 
480  REM ## via RS-232).
482  REM ##    A "BOOT" command requires special consideration.  It will not 
484  REM ## work in IBASIC since the program will not know where it should 
486  REM ## resume.  Also if it is sent via RS-232 it will normally not be  
488  REM ## echoed back before the "BOOT" starts.  
490  REM ##    If VXIDLD gives errors about your current configuration (such 
492  REM ## as needing to remove existing drivers or remove RDISK), and if
494  REM ## you don't have any other convenient way of sending those commands
496  REM ## then you may wish to insert the commands here. 
498  REM ##    If you wish to send any commands before VXIDLD checks the
500  REM ## configuration use lines like the following:
502  REM ##
504  REM #BEGINNING COMMAND=0,DIAG:DRAM:CRE 0;:DIAG:BOOT
506  REM ##
508  REM ##    If you wish to send any commands after VXIDLD has downloaded
510  REM ## system program data or re-booted with the requested memory,
512  REM ## before the driver(s) are downloaded, use lines like the
514  REM ## following:
516  REM ##
518  REM #SETUP COMMAND=0,SYST:BEEP
520  REM ##
522  REM ##    If you wish to send any commands after VXIDLD has re-booted 
524  REM ## with the drivers downloaded, but before the driver(s) are 
526  REM ## checked, use lines like the following:
528  REM ##
530  REM #CLEANUP COMMAND=0,DIAG:IBAS:DISP NONE
532  REM
